## üåå **Project Overview**
**ZeroG-Explorer** is a unique game designed to keep astronauts physically active and mentally sharp in microgravity. Players wear a gyroscope-equipped vest that controls their in-game avatar, allowing them to navigate through space by adjusting their orientation and using a thrust button. While floating through checkpoints and completing tasks, players also answer space-related quizzes, with real-time data pulled from NASA‚Äôs API.

The game tracks individual scores and ranks them on a global leaderboard. Space stations are also ranked based on the collective scores of their participants, fostering friendly competition and a sense of community between astronauts.

## üéÆ **Features**

### 1. **Physical Control with Gyroscope Integration**
- **Gyroscope-Equipped Vest**: Players wear a vest with a gyroscope, allowing their in-game avatar to mimic their real-world orientation and movement.
- **Thrust Mechanism**: Players use a thrust button to propel themselves forward, requiring careful control of both orientation and thrust to navigate checkpoints and complete tasks.

### 2. **Challenging Checkpoints and Tasks**
- Players must complete various tasks and navigate through space checkpoints.

### 3. **Space Knowledge Quizzes**
- **NASA API Integration**: Quizzes test players' knowledge of recent space events, using real-time data from NASA‚Äôs API.
- **Bonuses and Penalties**: Correct answers reward players with boosts (e.g., increased thrust power), while incorrect answers may apply temporary penalties.

### 4. **Leaderboard System**
- **Individual Leaderboard**: Tracks each player‚Äôs score based on their performance in navigating checkpoints, tasks, and quiz results.
- **Space Station Leaderboard**: A collective ranking system that highlights which space station has the highest overall scores, fostering competition and teamwork.

#### **No Real-time Multiplayer**
- **Asynchronous Play**: Due to the high latency between the astronauts stationed in different space stations, the game is not real-time multiplayer. Instead, players score individually, and the leaderboard reflects their rankings over time, allowing astronauts to compete at their own pace.

## üå† **Why ZeroG-Explorer?**

1. **Physical Exercise in Microgravity**: Promotes movement to help counteract the effects of prolonged exposure to microgravity, such as muscle atrophy and bone density loss.
   
2. **Mental Engagement**: Space quizzes keep astronauts mentally sharp and up-to-date with the latest developments in space exploration.

3. **Building Team Spirit**: The leaderboard system encourages astronauts from different space stations to engage in friendly competition, fostering connection across long distances in space.

Summary:

C-type CME detected by STEREO A / SOHO.

Start time of the event: 2024-09-08T01:36Z.

Estimated speed: ~626 km/s.

Estimated opening half-angle: 41 deg.

Direction (lon./lat.): 23/22 in Heliocentric Earth Equatorial coordinates.

Activity ID: 2024-09-08T01:36:00-CME-001

Based on preliminary analysis by the Moon to Mars Space Weather Analysis Office and heliospheric modeling carried out at NASA Community Coordinated Modeling Center, it is estimated that this CME may affect Parker Solar Probe, STEREO A, Lucy (glancing blow), and Mars (glancing blow). The leading edge of the CME will reach Parker Solar Probe at 2024-09-09T16:59Z and STEREO A at 2024-09-10T16:04Z and the flank of the CME may reach Lucy at 2024-09-11T20:00Z and Mars at 2024-09-12T02:00Z (plus minus 7 hours).

The simulation also indicates that the CME may impact NASA missions near Earth. Simulations indicate that the leading edge of the CME will reach NASA missions near Earth at about 2024-09-10T23:51Z (plus minus 7 hours). The roughly estimated expected range of the maximum Kp index is 4-6 (below minor to moderate).
